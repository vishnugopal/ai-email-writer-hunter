A good cold email will have these characteristics:

- **Personalization:** Even though it's unsolicited, a good cold email often includes personalized elements to make it relevant to the recipient.
- **Clear Purpose:** It clearly states the reason for reaching out.
- **Conciseness:** It is brief and to the point to respect the recipient's time.
- **Value Proposition:** It highlights why the recipient should care or benefit from engaging with the sender.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA):** It includes a specific request, such as scheduling a meeting, answering a question, or providing feedback.

Provide only the email and no other commentary.
